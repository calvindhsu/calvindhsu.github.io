My name is Calvin Hsu (pronounced like shoe), I've always been interested in using software to create something you *see* and something you *experience*. I need there to be visual output.

Interests:

* Realtime/Offline Rendering
* Game development
* GPU programming (OpenGL, OpenCL, CUDA)

This blog is to document my journey and thoughts.
