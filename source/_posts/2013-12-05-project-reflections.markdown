I've finally gotten around to documenting some of the work I've done for recent projects. It's been a helpful exercise to reflect on some of the process and decisions I've made.

At a glance looking back at my accomplishments seem small, I guess because they've already been solved! When I review the process of solving it, I can appreciate that those problems were quite difficult when I started and I can derive some confidence that I'm actually learning something :)

Here are two project reflections, now linked from the project page.

* [Champs: Battlegrounds](projects/champs.html)
* [Physically Based Renderer](projects/spbr.html)
