<p>Champs was a project that I was fortunate to receive the opportunity of driving and architecting the technical development of the game logic and client from start to finish. It was exciting turning point for Quark Games, original game design, and the company&rsquo;s first 3D, real-time game.</p>

<p>In short, it&rsquo;s a real-time multiplayer tactics game where players collect and train armies of &ldquo;Champs&rdquo; each with a wide range of unique abilities to defeat their opponents. Each Champ has a fixed pool of energy which constantly regenerates, and determines how often moves are executed. Terrain and positioning are critical, as certain tiles give energy regeneration bonuses.</p>

<h4>Stats</h4>

<ul>
<li>Company: Quark Games</li>
<li>Time: 11 months (09/12 &ndash; 08/13)</li>
<li>Technologies: C#, Unity3D, Websockets</li>
<li>Platform: iOS, Android</li>
<li>Role: Client Lead Engineer</li>
<li>Team size: 2-5 (including myself!)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Game logic engine</h4>

<p>This started as part of the client and ran on the device, but as the scope of the project expanded we decided to factor out the game logic into a separate component that could be run on both server and client (for offline play).</p>

<p>Initialization commands and player input are received by the library and processed at a 30ms tick. On the server this meant having a thread per game, and multiplexing connections. Output commands would contain the minimum necessary information: ids for visual outcomes, commands reporting critical game state (position, health, energy). This would give game designers the greatest flexibility to tweak damage, ranges, our effects of abilities. Since the client also included this library it could leverage shared code for predictive rule evaluation (i.e. evaluating whether a command was valid).</p>

<p>Configuration for units was placed in a human-readable JSON format, which was loaded as a &ldquo;template&rdquo; to instantiate classes with those config values. I wrote a lot of scripts to grab effect ids and animation timings out of Unity3D prefabs and to serialize them to be able to be read by our game logic engine. This allowed for us to leverage the Unity Editor as an artist tool without building our own custom solution.</p>

<h4>UI</h4>

<p>A lot of Champs is UI, or I should say a lot of any game is UI. Especially if your client team consists of 3.5 people and you need to implement everything from in-game HUD to store, army management, mission selection, overlays, settings menus, etc.</p>

<h4>HP/Energy Bars</h4>

<p>The HP/Energy bars were surprisingly problematic from a performance point of view, since the naive NGUI implementation gets you into trouble. We had 12 of them on the screen, and the time spent in CPU layout was eating up 30% of our frame time. NGUI modifies sizes and alpha by submitting new vertex positions and colors. If you implement hp/energy bars&#8217; outlines/dividers, alpha pulsing sprites with each element being a quad you end up with a dense amount of geometry that&rsquo;s being laid-out on CPU and being submitted to the GPU each frame.</p>

<p>The solution is obvious: use shaders! I used an NGUI quad (so it would still fit into our UI system), and overrode its material to use a custom shader. This turned 26 quads per Champ into 2 (which were static each frame). I pre-generated the dynamic outline/dividers once as a texture, and used UV coordinates to draw the bar from a 1D texture, and blended it in the fragment shader. CPU frame time eliminated and iPad3 FPS goes from 23 to it&rsquo;s vsync max of 30.</p>

<h4>Targetable area tinting</h4>

<p>We wanted to highlight which tiles were valid by tinting the rest of the screen. The naive implementation was to tint every material and unit that wasn&rsquo;t in the highlighted area. Besides bloating all of the other shaders and the extra time determining whether any object in the scene should be tinted, this was too expensive to be feasible.</p>

<p>The solution was to use screen space shaders. I thought, &ldquo;GPUs should have a stencil buffer&hellip;let&rsquo;s render the tiles we want highlighted into it.&rdquo; Unfortunately, Unity 4.1 didn&rsquo;t expose the stencil buffer, and rendering into a render texture was costly. So I exploited the fact that the majority of elements static elements in our scene didn&rsquo;t use alpha blending: encode the tint value (0 or 1) into the alpha channel, and reinterpret it while tweening the tint fade. More about how that broke down for Android later below.</p>

<h4>AI</h4>

<p>I can&rsquo;t beat the AI I programmed for Champs, which means I&rsquo;m either really bad at the game I developed (partially true I admit) or it&rsquo;s a precursor to Robot overlords. One of our talented game designers came up with the design of the AI that would use a heuristic scoring system to weigh potential actions. For moves, this meant evaluating the value of a tile&rsquo;s map position and weighing them against the damage score of a particular ability.</p>

<p>The system is able to compute the &ldquo;offensive value&rdquo; and &ldquo;vulnerability&rdquo; of any space given current enemy positions (in a tactics game units aren&rsquo;t constantly moving, this heuristic was roughly correct). This took into account for all range rules, terrain bonuses, pairwise damage between units. This was weighted against the damage values relative to the target&rsquo;s health: giving more weight to weaker units, but not enough to make them constantly give chase.</p>

<p>A big part in optimizing the system was providing tools for the designers. I wrote an AI heat map that would display each of the values computed for tiles, giving the designer a visual indication as to why the AI was making certain decisions, and allowing him to tweak weights on certain values per unit: leading to more aggressive or defensive behaviors.</p>

<p>Eventually we added heuristics for computing damage from triggering environment effects (i.e. pushing an enemy into mines), using remote detonate, planting mines/obstacles. The AI became so good a board went up with the score of people in the office vs AI. Most of them were losses :)</p>

<h4>Android Workarounds</h4>

<p>I have to put this in a category on our own, since the hacks to fix some issues in the very fragmented device space were crazy, but we were able to get the game to ship without graphical glitches!</p>

<p><strong>Alpha Channel and Stencil Buffer Woes</strong></p>

<p>Well when we got to preparing Android for ship the alpha hack fell apart. It turns out if you use an alpha enabled (32-bit) display buffer for some devices, pressing the volume controls or when the OS displays an overlay, the game would flicker like crazy. Obviously there was a problem with Unity&rsquo;s render context and the OS&rsquo;s screen compositing.</p>

<p>We were lucky that Unity 4.2 had shipped and exposed stencil buffer support, nice! Now I can do this cleanly and get rid of any alpha hacks. Turns out as well that still, some devices don&rsquo;t expose a stencil buffer (I believe the pattern was that stencil was only supported for devices that exposed the OES_packed_depth_stencil extension). Necessarily, my only option for those devices was to take the performance hit and use a render texture.</p>

<p><strong>Texture corruption when returning from a notification</strong></p>

<p>We hit a Unity bug where returning to the UnityPlayerActivity would cause our app to lose it&rsquo;s OpenGL context resulting in full texture corruption. I suspected it was because for some reason Android interpreted our return to the app as trying to launch a new instance. By luck and guessing I changed the launch Intent&rsquo;s class to the UnityPlayerNativeActivity and I set some flags which logs show were overridden, but that fixed the issue!</p>

<h4>Sample Projects and Hacks</h4>

<p><strong>Chocolate squires and Mud People</strong>
At one point, the week before release, we started panicking about this rare occurring issue that we suspected was a bug with Unity 4.2. For some reason we would load a scene (often our main game) and all the textures on our units would be black, except for our squire unit.</p>

<p>In searching for a cause or repro case, our QA team spent countless hours restarting games, searching for clues, seeing if it was isolated to a particular device, scene, or asset. I think one day they restarted through collectively 1000+ games.</p>

<p>In any case, once we realized that the problem occurred immediately when the scene starts. I went about writing a sample app so I could actually send a bug report to Unity and have them believe me that something crazy was happening. Sure enough I just needed to load some our assets into a plain old sample app that continuously reloaded the scene over and over again. Eventually it led to the units losing their textures and being totally black. Sometimes they would regain the textures on the next scene load, sometimes not.</p>

<p>Then a weird workaround was found. Maybe there was a bug with <code>Resources.Load(assetName)</code>, so instead I&rsquo;ll put links to the prefabs containing the models that I wanted to load and save them in resource manager prefab. By circumventing that API call, the issue went away. It still didn&rsquo;t explain the even less frequent occurrence of some statically loaded map elements being black though&hellip;</p>

<p>Lesson: sample apps allow you to iterate on crazy hacks and workarounds. Validate your guesses faster.</p>

<h4>Build Automation and Tools</h4>

<p>One of the things about working on a small team is the need to stay efficient. That means automate as much tasks as necessary, so you can focus on engineering and not on getting builds done. At Quark we focused a lot of efforts on creating a 1 command build script from Unity to Xcode archive + IPA, and then putting them onto a continuous integration &ldquo;server&rdquo; (i.e. extra Macbook Pro sitting on an empty desk ;) ) where anyone could download the .ipa and put it on their iPad.</p>

<p>Eventually we got the script to automatically increment version #, push the commit to the release branch, and print out the release notes with links to the github pull requests.</p>

<p>This was pure joy compared to the first few weeks of getting a pile of iPads and being told to load them up for a play test in the next few minutes. I always felt like that wasted probably 15-20 mins because you would switch branches to the latest stable build, reimport a bunch of assets, perform the build and installs, switch back to working branch, reimport, and try to remember where you last left off.</p>

<p>Lesson: automate automate automate, mundane tasks eating up brain space way more expensive than spending 2-3 workdays setting up a continuous integration server.</p>
